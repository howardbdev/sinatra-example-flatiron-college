Welcome to Flatiron College, a Sinatra application!

The app is designed to be used by instructors at a college.  Instructors can sign up, log in, and perform CRUD actions on courses they own.

Below are links to videos showing the app being built one step at a time.  Please note the disclaimer below.

These videos are long.  They are recordings of live study groups, and as such, may run off on tangents based on student questions and the whims of the instructor.  They may also contain some content that is outside the scope of what you need to do for your Sinatra project.  They are not tagged properly or indexed, either, so it may take some sifting to find what's helpful. Audio quality, and quality in general, is not guaranteed.  They are not part of the learn.co curriculum, but may be useful to students in the program.

Some examples of topics in these videos that are beyond the scope of what you need to do for the Sinatra project include:
- Multiple user model types:
  Early videos imply that we might have two different user models with login capability, instructor and student, but that is more complex than is needed at this level.  We end up just sticking with Instructor
- ActiveRecord validations:
  We use AR validations and errors in this project, but the curriculum doesn't really focus on them until Rails.  They are fairly simple to implement, but for the Sinatra project, checking params in controller actions is sufficient.
